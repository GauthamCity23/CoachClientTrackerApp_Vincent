# CoachClientTrackerApp_Vincent

-- We are going to make an APP

General Idea:
We are creating an app built for coaches/instructors/teachers to sync and link up with students. 
The coaches will log in, be able to see their upcoming sessions, on a calendar. They can toggle between Day, Week, Month and can switch to the prev or next of these time frames. They can click into a calendar event to see more info. 

The students can log in and see their upcoming sessions the same way, and can click for more info. 

Coaches should be able to see other coaches classes but can only modify or edit their own classes. 

Pages Required (As of now):
